            <p>As high school students, we had
                a lot of different tests for many different subjects, and we struggled to achieve the best results.
                After some research, we discovered that we were not the only ones, and that there were several barriers
                blocking high school students like us from getting the best results from their study.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>This lead us to come up with the idea of Oblisk.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The 2 major problems that people face in getting the most out of their study are:</p>
            <br>
            <p>1. Lack of motivation,</p>
            <br>
            <p>and 2. lack of understanding of how to actually study,</p>
            <br>
            <p>So we decided we had to find a solution.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our solution is simple: create study templates that can be used by anyone. We would like to add video
                tutorials for these templates. Our product is research backed, customizable and user-friendly. All study
                templates and materials will link to an educational video that will explain how to use the product
                effectively and assist people in developing their study skills. Our product will be available as a
                virtual, online product, but may also be purchased in a hard copy format and packages.</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Create Study templates that can be used by everyone</li>
                <li>We want to add linked video tutorials</li>
                <li>Product research backed, customisable and user-friendly</li>
                <li>Available virtually as well as physically</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Our target customer is ANYONE who needs to learn or remember ANYTHING. Imagine this. You’re in the prime
                of your life and you decide to go back to further your career, but now you have a full time job, a
                mortgage, 3 children, 2 dogs and no time to spare. Obelisk will help you study faster and more
                effectively. You NEED this in your life. Now, think of your children. They are teenagers like us. We
                have part time jobs, sports, assignments for 8 subjects, all coming to us at once.. WE NEED OBLISK IN
                OUR LIFE TOO! high school students, teachers, business and training organizations… Anyone that you can
                think of that needs to learn anything will benefit from this product.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It allows people to study FASTER and BETTER than they are currently, and in this world, this is what we
                need.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Oblisk may be used as a learning tool. This is no truer in the Australian Department of Defence, who can
                use our product to train members of the defence force for a number of different things such as equipment
                training, intelligence gathering, and more. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Unlike many products on the market, there are none that combine both study resources with an
                instructional video. Resource creators such as paper crane and study resource providers such as Quizlet
                are our main competitors for templates. However, we will be selling on multiple platforms, broadening
                our customer reach. We offer user friendly easy to use templates that are accompanied with instructional
                videos to help them study/train more efficiently and effectively.</p>

            <p>Our focus is in developing our resources with videos to accompany them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We aim to begin selling by July 2023, once our videos have been developed in full, and partner with
                schools, education providers and business in 2024. We then aim to spread to other countries by 2026.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To expand, we will need to gain popularity and reputation over time. Aswell as grow our network
                connections</p>
            <br>
            <p>To expand globally, we will need adequate resources, particularly production facilities, human resources
                and funding.</p>
